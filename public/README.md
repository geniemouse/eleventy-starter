# Vite's public assets directory

This is Vite's static assets folder. 

Vite will copy any files & folders from here into Eleventy's output directory, `./_site`.

By default, this directory is named `./public`. It can be renamed by `eleventy-plugin-vite`'s configuration settings (`./config/plugins/eleventy-plugin-vite.js`).
